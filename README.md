Challenge: create a component using the echarts api.

The component should be a graph comparing data blood pressure data to number of steps walked over time.
- Blood pressure data is taken at random an average of 5 times per week, and includes systolic and diastolic readings. There can be more than one data point per day.
- Steps walked has one entry per day, with more on average during the weekends.
- There may be a loose inverse correlation between blood pressure data and number of steps walked.
